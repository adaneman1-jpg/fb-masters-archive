# Preface: Discovering the Cyanotypes

Around 1977, when these images first came to my door, I immediately recognized the work of a talented artist. Of the more than 300 cyanotypes, over 100 exhibited the qualities of a trained and creative eye. But none were signed, and the ones with writing on the back gave little information that could lead to identification of the maker. It appeared to me at that time to be a near-hopeless endeavor to identify the creator, and therefore decided to sell them.

I divided the collection into three groups, each reflecting the best of the work and kept one group for myself. The other two sold at Sotheby's in 1979 and 1980, and from that moment I regretted selling them. Then one day at the Emeryville Image Show they resurfaced. The original buyer of both lots had kept them together until 2004 when I was lucky enough to buy the group back, minus a few that had been sold by the interim dealer. Again with some luck I was able to purchase most of the images back that had already been sold. Unfortunately one extremely important image was not among the collection and has yet to resurface. The missing image was the cover image of the first Sotheby sale and is the right view of a 2-part panorama shown to the right.

This volume is not meant to be a final work on the subject, but merely a sample of the amount of information I have uncovered up to this point and the outstanding quality of Masters' photographic images.

There are several key pieces of information still missing I would like to find before publication. These are not requirements to publication, but are none-the-less important elements to understanding Masters and his photographic work.

One question is how Masters came to photography and where he sought inspiration. We can see from MIT publications he was already interested in photography while still a student. This interest continued and blossomed in Wilmington at Howard Pyle's school and later after he moved to New York in 1905.

Another is the recollection by a grandson of visiting Edward Steichen with his grandfather who lived near each other in the 1950's in Connecticut. Were they friends from Masters' days in advertising in Manhattan, or through photography or just neighbors in Connecticut?

We see that during Masters' early years in art, his path criss-crossed some of the most prominent figures in American illustration. Masters was a talented artist, but unfortunately not destined to achieve the fame of those he knew, taught or studied under such as Charles Herbert Woodbury, Eric Pape, Howard Pyle, N. C. Wyeth, Maxfield Parrish and John Schoonover to name a few.

Where Masters stands out is in the brilliance of his photo-graphic imagery which touches on styles in photography yet to come in the 1910's, 1920's and 1930's. Had Frank Bird Masters believed himself to be a photographic artist, he would already be among those names his work parallels or predates such as Steichen, Strand, Steiglitz, Sheeler and Walker Evans to name a few. I believe Masters is a major undiscovered artist of the 20th century, but for his photographic work not his illustrations!
