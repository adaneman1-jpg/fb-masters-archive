# Chapter 2: Education and Artistic Training

Frank Bird Masters' education blended technical rigor with artistic awakening, forging a hybrid skill set that defined his illustration and photography. Entering MIT in 1891 at age 18, he pursued mechanical engineering, graduating in 1895 with an SB degree.[^1] His thesis, "An Investigation of the Errors of the Steam Engine Indicator," showcased analytical precision, but his artistic talents shone through illustrations for the 1895 Technique yearbook—a rebus frontispiece of birds drifting, later allegedly plagiarized by Rensselaer students.[^2] (Verified: MIT records; probable: early drawing practice.)

Post-graduation, Masters remained at MIT as an assistant instructor (1895–1897), supervising student projects like 100-hp steam boilers.[^3] He worked as a draftsman at B.F. Sturtevant (1895), "America's first fan company," and returned 1900–1902 for advertising.[^4] In 1896, he tested the West End Street Railway's Charlestown plant, experiences fueling his railroad art.[^5] From 1897–1900, he taught free-hand and mechanical drawing at Boston's Mechanic Arts High School, noted for excellence.[^6]

Photography emerged during MIT: A 1896 self-caricature featured a camera, and he won honorable mention in Youth's Companion's 1898 contest.[^7] This interest blossomed in Wilmington, Delaware, under Howard Pyle (1903–1905). Pyle, a master illustrator, mentored Masters in visual storytelling, praising his "rush and thunder" for dynamic scenes.[^8] Masters built a studio there, experimenting with cyanotypes as refs for illustrations—capturing atmospheric effects like misty evenings.[^9] (Verified: Pyle student list; probable: Wilmington as creative hub; speculative: Pyle's influence on modernism.)

Pyle's pedagogy—historical fidelity, emotional clarity—shaped Masters' method, linking him to Brandywine peers (deferred to Chapter 7). By 1905, married and in New York, Masters applied this training to magazine work, bridging engineering and art.

This chapter highlights Masters' transitional education, setting the stage for commercial success.
