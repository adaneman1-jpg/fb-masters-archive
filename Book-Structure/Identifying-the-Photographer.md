# Identifying the Photographer
Originally there was no identifying information on the photographs themselves that directly pointed to a specific maker. Closer examination of the inscriptions noted Wilmington, Delaware. 

 I planned a visit to the Delaware Historical Society in hopes of attributing the work. Also because of the predominance of railroad images, correspondence with railroad collectors and writers suggested Philadelphia as a possible source of information. Specifically the images of a Quaker Meeting Hall and the mention of being "... near the studio" pointed as well to Philadelphia as a location. In Philadelphia a collection of albums from the 1930's of every meeting hall in the northeastern United States did not contain the building shown. Nor did the albums of railroad images at the Library Company of Philadelphia contain any of Masters' views.The visit to the Delaware Historical Society was far more successful. The historian was immediately able to suggest the Pine Street Friends' Meeting Hall as the one in the image and had a copy image of the building, since demolished. 


 It was indeed the same. Then after reviewing city directories to find a studio near this location and comparing the different photographers' work in the archives, none matched.The Delaware historian then mentioned that a local resident had already compiled a list of all Wilmington photographers from the 1840's-1900. 

 I contacted him and heard him say that based on the description of the photographs he believed he knew the maker, Frank Bird Masters, one of the students of Howard Pyle. 


 He then supplied me with the data card on the next page for Masters. The handwriting matched and suddenly there was not only an artist's name, but also his education and some references to published work. 

From that moment basic research went extremely fast. On the same trip a visit to the New York Public library produced residences from the 1920 and 1930 census as well as the names of his spouse and children. 

 The 1920 reunion publication for the MIT class of 1895 produced the images on the right resulting in the identification of the self portrait above right.
