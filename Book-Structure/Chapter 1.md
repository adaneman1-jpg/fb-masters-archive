# Chapter 1: Family Background and Early Life

Frank Bird Masters was born on September 25, 1873, in Watertown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, into a family that embodied the practical ethos of New England industrialism.[^1] His mother, Mary Cutter Bird (1851–1913), and father fostered a household where mechanical ingenuity took precedence over artistic pursuits, steering young Frank toward engineering despite his early talent for drawing.[^2] The 1880 census places the family in Watertown, a bustling mill town, with siblings Lydia Warren (born 1876), L.W. (1877), Walter Chenery (1878–1953), and Mabel Cutter (b. 1882), reflecting stability amid economic growth.[^3] (Verified: U.S. Census records; probable: family oral histories.)

Masters' youth in Watertown—a hub of textiles and machinery—instilled a technical aptitude that later infused his art. He exhibited a "predilection and talent for drawing," but as an interviewer delicately noted, his path to artistry was "obliged to take a circuitous route."[^4] His "practical New England family" foresaw an engineering career, packing him off to MIT in 1891 at age 18.[^5] There, he flourished, graduating in 1895 with an SB in mechanical engineering. His senior thesis, "An Investigation of the Errors of the Steam Engine Indicator," testifies to his interest in power generation, while his drawing skills earned esteem: He illustrated the 1895 MIT yearbook, Technique, with birds drifting in a rebus frontispiece.[^6] In 1896, an anonymous letter to MIT's student newspaper alleged Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute students plagiarized it, punningly urging RPI to "originate their [own] master-pieces."[^7] (Verified: MIT publications.)

Post-graduation, Masters stayed at MIT for two years as an assistant instructor in engineering, supervising student-designed 100-hp steam boilers.[^8] He also worked as a draftsman at B.F. Sturtevant, "America's first fan company," in 1895 and returned 1900–1902 for their advertising department.[^9] In 1896, he assisted testing the West End Street Railway's Charlestown plant—experiences that informed his railroad-themed art.[^10] From 1897–1900, he taught free-hand and mechanical drawing at Boston Public's Mechanic Arts High School, earning special notice for his teaching.[^11]

By 1900, Masters, age 27, roomed at 19 Prospect Street in Watertown with a machinist family, just 0.7 miles—a 15-minute walk—from his second cousin once removed, Nancy Wyeth, at 24 Eliot Hill Road in Needham.[^12] This proximity, past mills and trolley lines, suggests early ties to the Wyeth artistic dynasty, though direct influence remains speculative until Chapter 7.[^13]

The rediscovery of Masters' cyanotypes in 1977 illuminates this era's mysteries. Over 300 images arrived unsigned, with inscriptions like "Wilmington, Delaware" offering clues.[^14] More than 100 revealed a "trained and creative eye," yet identification seemed hopeless, leading to Sotheby's sales in 1979–1980.[^15] Regret followed; repurchased in 2004 at Emeryville Image Show (minus the missing right-view panorama from the first sale's cover), they resurfaced as Masters' work.[^16] Attribution came via the Delaware Historical Society: A historian identified the Pine Street Friends' Meeting Hall (demolished), city directories ruled out other photographers, and a local list compiler named Frank Bird Masters, a Howard Pyle student.[^17] Handwriting matched a data card, revealing his education and published work.[^18] (Probable: Railroad motifs from family travels; speculative: Early cyanotypes as boyhood experiments.)

Basic research accelerated: The New York Public Library yielded 1920/1930 census residences, spouse Agnes Richards Hinnan (m. 1905), and children Malcolm (1910–1998) and Madeleine (1913–).[^19] The 1920 MIT Class of 1895 reunion publication confirmed a self-portrait.[^20]

Masters' early life embodies Golden Age tensions: industrial rigor yielding artistic "rush and thunder."[^21] This groundwork sets the stage for professional linkages, with gaps like photography origins (MIT interest, Wilmington blossom) awaiting illumination.
