? Early Life & Background
• Born: 1873, Watertown, Massachusetts.
• Early Talent: Exhibited a natural gift for drawing from a young age.
• Family Influence: Described as a “practical New England family” who steered him toward
engineering rather than art.
? Education at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
• Enrollment: Began in 1891, age 18.
• Graduation: 1895 with an SB (Bachelor of Science) in Mechanical Engineering.
• Senior Thesis: "An Investigation of the Errors of the Steam Engine Indicator"—reveals his
fascination with steam power.
? Campus Life & Recognition
• Yearbook Illustrator: Illustrated the 1895 MIT yearbook, Technique.
• Included a frontispiece rebus signed with birds around his name.
• Design Theft Incident: In 1896, The Tech reported RPI students had allegedly plagiarized
his yearbook design, including the bird rebus.
? Teaching & Postgrad Roles at MIT
• 1895–1897: Stayed at MIT as an assistant instructor in engineering.
• Duties included supervising 100-hp student-designed steam boilers.
• 1895 Draftsman: Worked at B. F. Sturtevant Company (America’s first fan company).
• 1896 Testing Role: Assisted in the testing of the Charlestown plant for the Boston West
End Street Railway.
? Teaching Outside MIT (Still Relevant to Engineering)
• 1897–1900: Taught freehand and mechanical drawing at Boston’s Mechanic Arts High
School.
• Recognized for exceptional instruction.
• Possibly overlapped with N.C. Wyeth’s student years (unknown if Wyeth was in his
class).
