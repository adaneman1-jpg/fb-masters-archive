# Introduction — Purpose, Sources, and Structure

This book restores Frank B. Masters (1874–?) to the documented history of American illustration by assembling verifiable records of his life, training, and professional output. Rather than advancing speculative claims of influence, the chapters that follow present primary-source evidence and contextualize Masters within the commercial magazine era and allied exhibition circuits.

Chapter 1 establishes the family, geographic, and economic setting in which Masters developed—Wellesley and the Boston environs—along with early signs of technical aptitude and access to craft and design culture. Chapter 2 traces formal training and mentorships, documenting study at MIT and three art schools, and his subsequent service as an instructor at both MIT and the Mechanics Arts High School (as already verified in our files). Chapter 3 consolidates publication and exhibition data into a working corpus: magazine contributions (including his Saturday Evening Post covers in 1904–1906 and interior work from 1903 onward) and a record of juried exhibitions and society shows, each tied to source citations and classified by evidentiary status (verified / probable / speculative).

## Method and Evidence
The project privileges archival and bibliographic sources: period magazines, exhibition catalogues, institutional records, and contemporaneous newspapers. Every data point is recorded with a citation and an evidence tag; only “verified” items shape narrative claims. “Probable” and “speculative” entries remain visible in notes for future testing, but they do not bear interpretive weight. This approach is carried through to the appendices (Exhibition Record; Illustrated Works by Publication; Genealogy), enabling scholars to audit and extend the dataset.

## Why Masters Matters
Masters’ career bridges technical drawing, fine-art exhibition, and high-circulation illustration at a moment when American visual culture industrialized. His dual role as educator (MIT; Mechanics Arts High School) and practitioner positions him within networks that trained—and sometimes funneled—talent into magazine and advertising markets. Subsequent chapters will situate his practice among peers active in the same exhibitions and annuals, without overclaiming causal influence.

## Organization
Chapter 1 provides biographical groundwork and genealogy relevant to later professional linkages documented in Chapter 7.

Chapter 2 details institutions, teachers, and curricula that shaped Masters’ technique and professional choices.

Chapter 3 presents the publication/exhibition ledger that underpins the arguments in Chapters 4–6.

A note on scope: connections to N.C. Wyeth, Howard Pyle, and the Brandywine circle are treated cautiously and deferred to Chapter 7; no claims are advanced here beyond what is documented in primary sources cited in Chapters 1–3.

## Conventions
Dates follow publication cover-dates unless evidence indicates production dates; titles reproduce period spellings; all magazines are cited at first mention with volume/issue/page, thereafter abbreviated. Exhibition citations follow catalogue title, venue, and year. Where ambiguity remains, it is flagged in notes rather than harmonized in the text.
Masters exhibited a predilection and talent for drawing in his youth.[^1]
