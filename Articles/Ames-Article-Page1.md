# RUSH & THUNDER of the TRAIN: The Life and Railroad Art of Frank B. Masters

**Gregory P. Ames**

A CENTURY AGO, F. B. MASTERS' NAME was familiar to thousands of readers, especially those fond of railroad fiction. Conjuring-up scenes as diverse as desolate desert track and teeming metropolitan railyards, not to mention portraits of the colorful characters that worked them, his illustrator's byline could be seen in periodicals ranging from American Magazine to the Saturday Evening Post. If an editor needed a dramatic railroad drawing, Masters was preeminent among the artists who could do the job.

Today, despite predictions to the contrary early in his career, few recognize Masters' name or work. One of his first publishers touted him as "likely to make no small reputation in the field of contemporary illustration."1 In 1911, even an art critic hostile to the illustrator's profession ("most pictures of the kind would better perish...") identified him along with a handful of other artists whose works, she claimed, "cry out for longer life."2
